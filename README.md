My name is Langston Kriel. I am currently studying Business Analytics in Clemson University's Masters of Business Administration Program. I have found that I enjoy programming and the capabilities it allows. I am on a hybrid path of self and institutional learning for Python, SQL, and BI tools (Qlik and Tableau in particular). I'm very interested in developing the data science skills to advance my analytical capabilities.
